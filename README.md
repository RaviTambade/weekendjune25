## 👨‍🏫 Mentor Storytelling Launch Message

> **"Welcome to Transflower Acceleration Program—where your testing journey becomes the launchpad for your development career."**

> You’ve spent years finding defects, raising bugs, testing apps. You know how to **break things the right way**—and that means you already think like a developer.

> Now imagine this: what if you **built** the features you once tested? What if you moved from the **right side of the V-Model** (Validation) to the **left side** (Design & Development)? That’s not just a shift—it’s a transformation.

> At Transflower, we’ve crafted a 12-week weekend journey just for you—a step-by-step skill-building experience that turns a quality analyst into a full-stack creator. Let me walk you through it...
