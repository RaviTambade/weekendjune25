## From Tester to Developer – You Can Make It Too!

**Session Theme:** *"Every Tester has the potential to be a Developer with the right mindset, learning path, and mentorship."*
> By Ravi Tambade – Transflower Mentor

👋 **Hi everyone,**
Today I want to speak directly to all of you who are working as testers – manual, automation, QA, or even interns who feel boxed into the "testing" tag. I’ve seen this journey up close – and today, I want to walk you through a **real story** that reflects the power of perseverance, focus, and learning.

Let’s understand it like a **coach to athlete** – my role is to show you the track, the hurdles, and how to leap over them.


### 🛠️ **Phase 1: Start Where You Are – Respect the Testing Phase**

Our story begins like many of yours – a fresh graduate, trained in Java, full of development dreams, but placed in a **manual testing project**.

As a mentor, I always say:

> **"Your first role is your platform, not your prison."**

Testing teaches you the structure of systems, user behavior, and what real-world quality means. But I also understand the frustration – screenshots, documentation, repetition… it feels disconnected from the core development action.

So the question is – **how do you move forward?**


### 🚀 **Phase 2: Take Ownership of Learning – No One Will Push You Forever**

This person took **ownership** – enrolled in an internal backend training on **Java, Spring, and Spring Boot**.
He didn’t **wait** for a new assignment to learn development.

He learned at night.
Practiced capstones.
Watched videos when stuck.
Used **real-world blockers as learning opportunities**.

As a mentor, I always recommend:

* ✅ Learn one full backend stack: Java + Spring Boot OR .NET + ASP.NET Core
* ✅ Practice building 2–3 small end-to-end modules (REST API + DB + Unit Tests)
* ✅ Understand where your current testing fits in the **architecture**


### 🌱 **Phase 3: Encouragement is Fuel, But Action is Yours**

He was noticed by his **test lead** and given a testing role in a **microservices project** built with **Spring Boot, Kafka, and AWS**.

Even though it was testing again, the environment was rich.
He began to understand:

* Microservices architecture
* Kafka messaging
* AWS deployment pipelines

> "When you're near the kitchen long enough, you learn how the chef works."

He didn’t just test – he learned the logic behind each service, how it was deployed, and how to troubleshoot it.


### ⚖️ **Phase 4: Struggles, Distractions & Depression – It Happens**

Let me be honest – this phase hits everyone.

There were distractions – Selenium, REST-Assured, DevOps, trying everything.
There was **confusion** – *“Will I ever get into development?”*
There were times he **almost gave up**.

But what brought him back?

> "A reminder of why he started – and a deep commitment to continue."

He re-focused: Spring Security, OAuth2, Design Patterns. He **invested in his foundation**.

As a mentor, I always say:

> 🧭 **“Learn deeply, not just widely.”** Pick your tech stack and go full depth.


### 🏁 **Phase 5: The Breakthrough – Preparation Meets Opportunity**

Finally – **he got a developer interview**.
He wasn’t lucky. He was **ready**.

He explained:

* Previous project roles clearly
* Architecture of systems
* Dev-Tester collaboration
* How he contributed to AWS-based solutions

He got the job. Then came **his first developer project**.
He didn't panic – he debugged, explored batch processes, Docker, GCP, CI/CD, even redesigning modules using **SOLID principles**.

That’s not beginner stuff. That’s **real developer impact.**

### 📚 **Phase 6: Continuous Growth & Mentorship**

He paired with senior architects.
Learned TDD.
Practiced with GitHub Copilot.
Explored Prompt Engineering.

He’s still learning. Still improving. And that’s what makes a great developer.

## 🎯 **Key Mentor Advice to Testers**

Here’s what I want you to take away from this:

### 🔑 1. **Respect Testing, but Design Your Transition**

* Testing teaches flow, behavior, analysis.
* But build **developer muscles** on your own: logic, code, design.

### 🔑 2. **Balance Work + Learning**

* Work by day, learn by night. Slowly shift your strength.
* Use projects as learning labs.

### 🔑 3. **One Stack at a Time**

* Java + Spring Boot + MySQL + JPA
  OR
* C# + ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQL Server
* Learn testing tools like JUnit/NUnit, Postman, and automation scripting.

### 🔑 4. **Prepare for Opportunity Before It Knocks**

* Practice mock interviews
* Prepare project explainers
* Know your architecture

### 🔑 5. **Don’t Just Code – Understand**

* How apps are deployed
* What CI/CD means
* Why design patterns matter
* What testing teaches about good code


### 🧘 **Final Mentor Note – The 3Fs**

* 🔥 **Focus** on your tech stack
* 💪 **Fight** your doubts with action
* 🙏 **Faith** in your path, your process, and your progress

The transition from testing to development isn’t a shortcut.
It’s a well-designed detour. You’re just taking the scenic route – and that’s okay.

You’re not behind. You’re on your own perfect timeline.
Tap your potential.
