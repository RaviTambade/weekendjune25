### Who is a Manual Tester?**

Hi friends 👋

Before automation tools, before AI, before all the buzzwords…
There was **Manual Testing** — the foundation of software quality.

Let me share a simple story:


### 🧑‍💻 Imagine this...

You’ve just developed a **login page**. It has two fields:
📥 Username
🔒 Password
🔘 Login Button

Before giving it to the customer, you ask:

> “Can someone check if this page works properly?”

A **Manual Tester** steps in.

They open the browser, enter valid and invalid credentials, press login, check for success or error messages, and make sure nothing crashes or behaves unexpectedly.

No automation. No tools. Just human brain + keyboard + browser.
That’s **manual testing**.


### 🔍 **Definition: Manual Tester**

> A **Manual Tester** is a software professional who tests applications **by hand** — without using automation scripts or tools — to find bugs, validate features, and ensure the product works as expected.


### ✅ What Does a Manual Tester Do?

| Activity                  | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📋 Read requirements      | Understand what the software is supposed to do.                      |
| 🧪 Create test cases      | Write step-by-step checks (e.g., “Enter valid email, click Submit”). |
| 💻 Execute tests          | Manually perform actions on the UI to see if it behaves correctly.   |
| 🐞 Report bugs            | Log issues in a bug tracking tool (e.g., JIRA, Bugzilla).            |
| 🔁 Re-test                | Once dev fixes bugs, test again to confirm fix.                      |
| 🧠 Do exploratory testing | Try unusual actions to break the app or find hidden bugs.            |

### 🚫 What Manual Testing is NOT:

* It’s **not coding-based**.
* It **doesn’t use Selenium or automation scripts**.
* It’s **not repetitive automation execution**.

### 🧠 Skills of a Good Manual Tester

| Skill                | Why it’s important                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Attention to detail  | Catches small but critical bugs    |
| Analytical thinking  | Tests edge cases developers forget |
| Communication        | Clearly reports and describes bugs |
| Patience & curiosity | Tries different scenarios calmly   |

### 🔁 Manual Testing is Still Important

Even in 2025, when AI and automation are everywhere:

* Manual testing is crucial for **UI/UX**, **usability**, **exploratory**, and **ad hoc** testing.
* Every automation test starts from a **manually written test case**.

### 🛣️ Growth Path for a Manual Tester

1. Learn **bug reporting**, **test case writing**, **test management tools**.
2. Get confident with **test scenarios**, **edge cases**, and **exploratory testing**.
3. Transition into **Automation Testing** with tools like Selenium, Playwright.
4. Later explore **Performance**, **Security**, or even **DevOps testing**.


### 🧭 Final Thought from a Mentor

> “Manual testers are the first defense line in quality assurance. Automation can speed things up — but a manual tester adds **human judgment**, **creativity**, and **real user behavior** that scripts cannot.”
